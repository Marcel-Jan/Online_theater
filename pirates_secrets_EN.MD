# Secrets for Lockdown theater 3: Pirates!

## Secrets of the characters
The director sends each player their own secrets.

### Henry Jennings
* Hornigold is your rival. You have tried to capture him a couple of years ago and stole one of his ships. Yet you kind of need his fleet for this republic of pirates to work.
* One of Hornigold's apprentices, has made you miss out on a large price.

### Benjamin Hornigold
* Financially things aren't going well at the moment. You haven't managed to rob a lot of ships as of late. Your crew might vote you down as captain of your ship.
* Jennings is your rival. He tried to capture you a few years ago and stole one of your ships. Yet you kind of need his fleet for this republic of pirates to work.
* Jennings and his apprentices managed to win this last price with more luck than wisdowm actually. And they really used a lot of unnecessary force. Multiple people died. That would not have happened to you.

### Nicholas Trott
* You have been made governor of this God forsaken island by the king of England. Well, finally you have a good opportunity to make this poor job worth your while. Who cares that a lot of these pirates want to despose of the king?

### Blackbeard
* You have been loyal to Hornigold. But he hasn't brought in a lot of cash flow as of late. When you manage to win a price, it's often because of you.

### 'Calico' Jack Rackham
* There's something about that Mark Reed. You're honestly heterosexual, but he looks rather good for some reason.

### Anne Bonny
* Your husband does not fight like a man.
* You discovered that Mark Reed is a woman. Cool! You've proposed her as crewmember and she has been accepted.

### Mark Reed
* Your real name is Mary Reed. You have always dressed as a boy.
* But you aren't really attracted to men.

### John King
* You have been a pirate now for two whole weeks and.. you will never admit it, but .. you kind of would rather go back to your mother. Rather a lot.


## Bonus secret!
Half way through the play the director can reveil an extra secret that will be of influence on the relationships between characters. That secret is:
* The King of England has offered a pardon to all pirates: stop now and you can keep your income. Keep attacking ships and lose your head (unless it benifits England in some way, but that's besided the point).
* Hornigold and his apprentices will acccept this pardon.
* Jennings and his apprentices will not accept the pardon. They want to keep being pirates. But Mark Reed might want to quit while he's ahead.
* For John King this is a rather elegant escape (as a 10 year old probably wouldn't explain it).
