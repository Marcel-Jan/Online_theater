# Lockdown theater 3: Pirates!
You are on the island Nassau in the Caribean. You have started a republic of pirates here. Many of you have served the English navy in your past and they had a cruel regime. Like many pirates, you have decided to do things differently. On your ships (that you managed to rob) is an enlightened democracy. And lots of crews of other ships rather liked that and decided to join you. This was one of the secrets of your success.

## Setting
Here ends the historically accurate part. (I've taken some liberties to make the story a little more interesting.)

We are in the year 1717. Henry Jennings and his crew managed to gain a large English sloop yesterday. With this extention of the pirate fleet you rule the Caribean completely. Your Republic of Pirates is pretty safe now.
Tonight Jennings wil hold a large party on the beach of Nassau. There will be rum. And lots of it.

## How this improvisation works (short version)
Your group has one director and multiple players. Every player is assigned a character from the list below or choses one and tells the director. You don't need all characters. The director sends each player their own secrets. There also is a bonus secret that the director can reveil halfway.

## The characters
### Henry Jennings
You have started this republic of pirates, together with Benjamin Hornigold.
You have been a mentor for pirates like 'Calico' Jack Rackham.
You have no problem robbing English ships. Or any ship for that matter.

### Benjamin Hornigold
You came up with the idea of this republic of pirates. And Henry Jennings decided to join.
You have been a mentor of pirates like Edward Teach (Blackbeard).
You have been very successful in robbing French and Spanish ships, but you don't want any troubles with the English fleet.
You don't like violence if it's not necessary. Usually it isn't. And that's what you always told your apprentices.

### Nicholas Trott
Governor of the island of Nassau. Well, in name then.
One of Hornigold's people has made a great deal with you. As long as they send you the silver and gold, it's all fine by you.

### Blackbeard, or Edward Teach
You've created an enormous reputation as a pirate. Most of your successes are based on that whole act you play when you enter a ship. You look like a mad man, with your big, unruly beard and your had with lit fuses attached. Usually gives the crew of the ships you rob the idea they are meeting a daemon. But actually you are rather a gentleman.

### 'Calico' Jack Rackham
After Jennings took you under his wing, you have become a rising star in the pirate republic.
And everyone has every right to know that you are very successful. You dress well. That's why everyone knows you as 'Calico Jack'. (Calico being a fine woven type of linnen with beautiful colours.)
You are a party animal.
Oh yes, your wife, Anne Bonny, accompanies you during your voyages. She also fights. Rather well.

### Anne Bonny
You are Jack Rackham's wife. You have been accepted by the crew after you have shown you are pretty good at sword fighting and shooting.

### Mark Reed
Two years ago you have joined the Dutch navy. That's how you went to the Caribean. But then peace broke out and that kind of sucked. No more fighting to do. So you joined the pirate crew of Jack Rackham. And you've shown them what you are capable of. When there's fighting to do, you are usually in the first ranks.

### John King
You are the youngest pirates of all. How young? 10 years. And this is how that happened: the ship of your father was taken over by pirates. Your father wasn't on that ship (which was for the better: he always beats you). But you and your mother were on that ship. And it became rather clear right away that piracy is totally your thing. Yes, your mother was livid. Well, served her right for chosing your father's side EVERY time. 

At first Hornigold was having none of it, a ten year old on his ship. But thanks to your brovado he came around after a few days. He started to think it would be kind of funny.
