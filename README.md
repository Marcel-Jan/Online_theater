## Inleiding
We hadden met onze spelers net een toneelgroep gevormd: Hein en de Ruitenwissers (https://www.facebook.com/watch/Hein-en-de-Ruitenwissers-103544317956772/). We hadden een oefenzaal, een regisseur, social media pressence en een script. Na twee keer oefenen begon de corona crisis. En daar zit je dan thuis je teksten te leren. Dus niet, h√®. Want wanneer komt het ooit op de planken? Juni? September? 2022?

We wilden wel met elkaar blijven spelen. Dus zijn we gaan improviseren. Letterlijk. Het boek Nachtgasten was leuke inspiratie (http://nachtgasten.nl/Home.html). Maar het was wel veel leeswerk en niet iedereen had er tijd voor.

Op een gegegven moment kwam ik op het idee van corona theater met korte beschrijvingen van personages en slechts 1 of 2 geheimen. Dat is in eerste instantie het verhaal van de Abel Plesmantoren geworden:

## Introduction
We had just created our theatre group: Hein en de Ruitenwissers (https://www.facebook.com/watch/Hein-en-de-Ruitenwissers-103544317956772/) (translated: Hein and the Screenwipers. Look, it's a long story)

We had a room to practice in, a director, social media presence and a script. After two times, the corona crisis started and we could no longer play together in one room anymore. At first we tried to learn our lines from the script. Except that never really took of. Because when are we going to play this? June? September? 2022?

We wanted to keep playing via video conferencing, but we needed something else. So we started to improvise. Literally. I had a book with improv techniques called "Nachtgasten" (only available in Dutch) and that was fun. But it was a lot of reading and not everyone had time for that.

So one time I came up with a short form called Lockdown Theater with enough characters for our group of 7 to play. And per character only a short description and only one or two secrets. And that became the first improvisation theater story: Lockdown on the Tasman Tower. After a while everyone got really sick of corona-related stories and that's when I wrote Pirates!.

## How does it work?
### Characters
Every story has seven or more characters. If your group is smaller than seven, it's usually not necessary to have all characters. One person in your group is the director, who can also play one of the characters (or come in a little later when everyone starts getting the hang of things).

### The director
As a director it's your job to keep the story interesting. Make sure players aren't going in circles. And maybe ask one of the players who has been quiet for a while to join in. Usually video conferencing has a chat function, by which you can send acting directions to everyone.

At the beginning, you as the director either assign the characters to the players. You can also send the list of characters to everyone, after which the players send back their preferred character to play. I usually do this in a first come, first serve manner. If everyone has a role, you send each player their own secrets.

If you are in a large group, you can have multiple directors who make sure the story keeps on rolling.

### Secrets
The secrets are meant to spice the story up and keep it going. They get reveiled during the play. Your character's secret might be that you are madly in love with another character. Or that one character has done something rotten to you in her youth and you have never forgiven her. Or your secret might be that you want your teams mission to fail out of spite of the commander or that it was you who totalled the car of another player yesterday and we are slowly getting that during the play. It's always fun to discuss who had what secret afterwards to see if everyone got that. 

If you are the director and you notice the play hasn't gotten anywhere for a while, you can ask one of the players to reveil one of their secrets right away.
